Here we go...let's try this.

```
library(CIM)
?CIM
```

```
## Read in the two data.frames included in the package
m <- male
f <- female
```

```
## Run the function using "ratio" calculation
CIM.ratio <- CIM(m, f, calculation = "ratio", numerator = 1, denominator = 2)
## Print the resulted data.frame
CIM.ratio
```

This post introduces our recently published R package, CIM, to measure the impacts of migration on local population structures. We developed the methodology in this [paper](https://doi.org/10.1080/00324728.2017.1416155) in 2018. This paper is one of the top ten most viewed articles in [Population Studies](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/showMostReadArticles?journalCode=rpst20)

## Installing
```{r}
library(CIM)
```

```{r}
## Read in the two data.frames included in the package
m <- male
f <- female

## Run the function using "ratio" calculation
CIM.ratio <- CIM(m, f, calculation = "ratio", numerator = 1, denominator = 2)
## Print the resulted data.frame
CIM.ratio

```

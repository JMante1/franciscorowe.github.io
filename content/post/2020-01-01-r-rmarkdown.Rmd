# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```
library(CIM)
```

```
## Read in the two data.frames included in the package
m <- male
f <- female

## Run the function using "ratio" calculation
CIM.ratio <- CIM(m, f, calculation = "ratio", numerator = 1, denominator = 2)
## Print the resulted data.frame
CIM.ratio
```

While this first session may seem to revolve around basic ideas, they provide the foundation for latter sessions.

If you are already familiar with *R*, R notebooks and data types, you may want to jump to the section *Read Data* and read from there. This section describes how to read data -which you may know- but you may not know how to make use of `tidyverse` functions. This section describes some of the basic `tidyverse` functions, such as `mutate()`, `%>%` (known as pipe operator), `select()`, `filter()` and specific packages and functions how to manipulate spatial data.
